## Fresh session prompt — Step 9: split `HomeDashboard.tsx`

```
Read portfolio/clarity-budget-web/CLAUDE.md and portfolio/clarity-budget-web/HANDOFF.md first.
Run checkpoint before touching anything.

Continuing: clarity-budget-web, branch main
Last work: Step 8 (Privacy connector + card mapping) implemented locally 2026-04-28.

## State coming in

Steps 1–8 all implemented. Step 8 may or may not be deployed yet — check `git log -1`
on main vs the production deployment.

If Step 8 is uncommitted: review the diff (lib/ynab.ts, settings/page.tsx, 5 new files
under app/api/settings/, app/api/ynab/payees/, components/settings/), then:
  git add -A && git commit -m "feat(clarity-budget-web): /settings Privacy connector + card mapping (Step 8)"
  git push

If Step 8 is committed but not deployed: just push to main.

After deploy:
  - Sign in at clarity-budget-web.vercel.app
  - /settings → Privacy card visible. Enter Privacy.com token → Save.
  - Trigger backfill so cards are available:
      curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" \
        https://clarity-budget-web.vercel.app/api/cron/backfill \
        -H "content-type: application/json" -d '{"days_back":30}'
  - Reload /settings → CardMappingTable should list cards. Pick a payee for at least
    one card → reload to confirm persistence.

## Step 9 — split HomeDashboard.tsx

components/HomeDashboard.tsx is ~600+ lines and mixes STS math UI, shortfall banner,
last-updated chip, empty state, and YNAB role mapping. Extract into focused components:

- components/dashboard/StsCard.tsx — month/week/day safe-to-spend numbers
- components/dashboard/ShortfallBanner.tsx — "you're $X over for this week" banner
- components/dashboard/LastUpdated.tsx — refresh button + cache timestamp
- components/dashboard/EmptyState.tsx — links to /settings for first-time users

Goal: HomeDashboard.tsx becomes a thin shell that wires data + props. No behavior change.

Plan: plans/clarity-budget-web-redesign.md (Step 9).
```

## What was built — 2026-04-28: Step 8 — `/settings` Privacy connector + card mapping (local)

### New files
- `components/settings/PrivacyConnectorCard.tsx` — mirrors YnabConnectorCard's three modes (stored / replacing / new). POST `/api/credentials { privacy_token }`. Hint copy clarifies that the daily cron is what actually pulls cards.
- `components/settings/CardMappingTable.tsx` — fetches cards (`GET /api/settings/cards`) and YNAB payees (`GET /api/ynab/payees`) on mount. Each row: card memo + state/type chip + payee `<select>` bound to `linked_payee_id`. Optimistic update with rollback on PATCH error. Empty state when no cards yet.
- `app/api/settings/cards/route.ts` — GET; user-scoped query of `clarity_budget_privacy_cards` ordered by memo.
- `app/api/settings/cards/[token]/route.ts` — PATCH `{ linked_payee_id: string | null }`. Auth + ownership + audit log (`action='card_payee_linked'`). Mirrors `proposals/[id]/route.ts`.
- `app/api/ynab/payees/route.ts` — GET; uses `loadYnabCredentials` (decrypts token + self-heals `default_budget_id`) → `fetchPayees`.

### Modified files
- `lib/ynab.ts` — added `fetchPayees(token, budgetID)` + `YNABPayee` type. Filters out deleted + transfer payees, sorts alphabetically.
- `app/(app-shell)/settings/page.tsx` — credentials probe now also reads `privacy_token_ciphertext`. Renders `<PrivacyConnectorCard>` below YNAB card; conditionally renders `<CardMappingTable />` when `hasEncryptedPrivacyToken` is true.

### Verification
| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` | ✅ clean |
| `pnpm lint` (touched files) | ✅ clean (`scripts/merge-ai-gateway-from-dev.cjs` errors pre-exist this session) |
| `pnpm exec vitest run` | ✅ 49/49 |
| `pnpm build` | ✅ clean — `/api/settings/cards`, `/api/settings/cards/[token]`, `/api/ynab/payees` all `ƒ` dynamic; `/settings` page 4.59 kB |
| `curl GET /api/settings/cards` (unauth) | ✅ 401 |
| `curl GET /api/ynab/payees` (unauth) | ✅ 401 |
| `curl PATCH /api/settings/cards/fake-token` (unauth) | ✅ 401 |
| `curl GET /settings` (unauth) | ✅ 307 → `/login` |

### Notes
- **No new migration needed.** `clarity_budget_privacy_cards.linked_payee_id` column already exists from `0001_init.sql`. `/api/credentials` already accepts a `privacy_token` field (Step 1).
- **`/settings` page redirects unauth → 307**, then API routes return 401 because middleware doesn't gate them. Once signed in, both routes return JSON.
- `pnpm build` corrupted the running dev server's `.next` (ENOENT storm on `_buildManifest.js.tmp.*`). Fix: `rm -rf .next` + `preview_stop` + `preview_start`. Same as Step 6.

---

## What was built — 2026-04-28: Step 7 — `/flags` UI (commit `2861907`)

### New files
- `app/(app-shell)/flags/page.tsx` — async server component; queries `clarity_budget_flags` (status=open, user-scoped) via `createRouteClient()`; passes list to `<FlagList>`.
- `components/flags/FlagList.tsx` — client component; owns `flags` state; optimistic removal on dismiss.
- `components/flags/FlagRow.tsx` — per-type rendering (title + contextual subtitle from `details` JSON); severity chip (high→danger, medium→caution, low→muted); single Dismiss button → PATCH `/api/flags/${id}`.
- `app/api/flags/[id]/route.ts` — PATCH; 401/404/403/409 gates; writes `status='acknowledged'` + `acknowledged_at`; audit log `action='flag_dismissed'` with `{type, severity}` payload.

### Modified files
- `components/shell/NavBar.tsx` — added Flags link between Review and Settings.

### Schema note
`clarity_budget_flags` columns: `type` (not `flag_type`), status enum `'open'|'acknowledged'` (not 'dismissed'), `acknowledged_at` (not `resolved_at`). DB CHECK constraint is authoritative. Button label stays "Dismiss"; body `{ action: "dismiss" }` maps to `status='acknowledged'` in the route.

### Verification
tsc ✅ · lint ✅ (touched files) · build ✅ · `GET /flags` unauth → 307 `/login` · `PATCH /api/flags/[fake-id]` unauth → 401 · deployed `clarity-budget-web.vercel.app` (`2861907`)

---

## What was built — 2026-04-28: Step 6 — `/review` UI

### New files
- `app/(app-shell)/review/page.tsx` — async server component; queries `clarity_budget_proposals` (status=pending, user-scoped) via `createRouteClient()`; passes list to `<ProposalList>`.
- `components/review/ProposalList.tsx` — client component; owns `proposals` state; removes items client-side on resolve (no page reload).
- `components/review/ProposalRow.tsx` — client component; shows `current_payee_name → proposed_payee_name`, confidence chip (green ≥80%, gold <80%), reason; Approve/Dismiss buttons PATCH `/api/proposals/${id}`.
- `app/api/proposals/[id]/route.ts` — PATCH handler; validates auth + ownership + pending status; updates `status/resolved_at/resolved_by_action`; on approve: looks up privacy transaction → card token → sets `clarity_budget_privacy_cards.linked_payee_id`; writes audit log.

### Modified files
- `components/shell/NavBar.tsx` — added "Review" link between Categorize and Settings.

### Schema note
DB constraint uses `'approved'/'dismissed'` (not 'accepted'/'rejected' as the HANDOFF previously said). Route uses schema values.

### Verification
tsc ✅ · lint ✅ · build ✅ · `GET /review` → 307 `/login` (unauthenticated) ✅

## What was built — 2026-04-28: Settings migration loop fix + categorize unblocked

### Problems solved
1. **`/categorize` schema cache error** — `Could not find the table 'public.clarity_budget_categorization_suggestions'`. Migration `0003` was written locally but never pushed. Fixed: `pnpm supabase migration repair --status reverted 20260426174142 20260426174204 && pnpm supabase db push`. Table now live in project `unqtnnxlltiadzbqpyhh`.
2. **AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY** — Preview deployments had no key (only Production + Development). Fixed 2026-04-28: REST API created Preview env; `scripts/merge-ai-gateway-from-dev.cjs` + `pnpm run env:pull-local` fixes local `.env.local`.
3. **Settings yellow banner loop** — `MigrationBanner` reappeared every time the user entered their YNAB token in `/settings`. Root cause: banner had no awareness of the Supabase encrypted row; clearing localStorage on migrate made `YnabConnectorCard` show an empty field; user re-entered; localStorage refilled; banner reappeared.

### Fix (commit `7a461b6`)
- `app/(app-shell)/settings/page.tsx` — async server component; queries `clarity_budget_credentials.ynab_token_ciphertext`; passes `hasEncryptedYnabToken: boolean` to children.
- `components/settings/MigrationBanner.tsx` — accepts `hasEncryptedYnabToken` prop; hides immediately when true; **does NOT clear localStorage on success** (HomeDashboard reads token from there).
- `components/settings/YnabConnectorCard.tsx` — accepts `hasEncryptedYnabToken` prop; `stored = hasEncryptedYnabToken && !replacing`. Stored mode: "Token stored in Supabase ✓ [Replace]" + budgets from server proxy. Replace mode: `ReplaceTokenInput` sub-component.
- `app/api/ynab/budgets/route.ts` — new GET endpoint; decrypts YNAB token server-side, returns `{ budgets }`. Does NOT use `loadYnabCredentials` (which errors on null `default_budget_id`).

### Verification
tsc ✅ · lint ✅ · vitest 49/49 ✅ · build ✅ · commit `7a461b6` on main · preview deployment 401 on `/api/ynab/budgets` ✓

### What's still needed
- Promote preview to production (or push a trivial commit to trigger GitHub auto-deploy)
- Signed-in smoke test on production

---

## What was built — Session N: Categorize fix + Settings connector (2026-04-26)

### Problem
`/categorize` threw `"default_budget_id not set on credentials row"`. The `clarity_budget_credentials` row had the encrypted YNAB token but `default_budget_id` was always NULL — no UI had ever written it. The selected budget lived only in `user_data.data.ynabBudgetId` (app_key="clarity_budget"), which server-side categorize endpoints never read.

### Fix — shared credentials loader with self-heal fallback

**New:** `lib/categorize/credentials.ts` — `loadYnabCredentials(supabase, userId)`:
1. Read `clarity_budget_credentials` row.
2. If token ciphertext missing → throw `"ynab token not configured"`.
3. If `default_budget_id` set → decrypt + return immediately.
4. Fall back: read `user_data` where `app_key = SUPABASE_APP_KEY`, pull `data.ynabBudgetId`.
5. If found → fire-and-forget backfill of `default_budget_id`, decrypt + return.
6. If still missing → throw `"no YNAB budget selected — open Settings and pick one"`.

**Modified:** `lib/categorize/run.ts` — removed local `loadYnabCreds()` (was lines 40–75); imported shared loader. Both call sites updated.

**Modified:** `app/api/categorize/apply/route.ts` — removed local `loadCredentials()` (was lines 28–59); imported shared loader. All three call sites updated.

### YNAB connector moved to Settings

**New:** `components/settings/YnabConnectorCard.tsx` — client component with:
- YNAB token input: read/write localStorage `YNAB_TOKEN_KEY`; on change, POST `/api/credentials { ynab_token }`.
- Budget picker: read/write `BudgetBlob.ynabBudgetId` via `loadLocalBlob` / `saveLocalBlob` / `pushBlob`; on change, POST `/api/credentials { default_budget_id }`.
- Budget list populated from `fetchBudgets(token)`.

**Modified:** `app/(app-shell)/settings/page.tsx` — renders `MigrationBanner` + `YnabConnectorCard` (was a stub with a placeholder).

**Modified:** `components/HomeDashboard.tsx`:
- Removed: token input `<section>`, `BudgetPicker` component definition, `persistToken` function.
- Removed: `fetchBudgets` import (only used by BudgetPicker).
- Moved `loadLocalBlob` / `saveLocalBlob` to `lib/blob.ts` as exports (shared by YnabConnectorCard).
- YNAB section renamed "Category roles"; wrapped in `{ynabReady && (...)}`.
- Empty state now links to `/settings` instead of "pick a budget below".

**Modified:** `lib/blob.ts` — added exported `loadLocalBlob()` and `saveLocalBlob()` with SSR guard.

### Verification results

## Fresh session prompt — smoke test + Step 6

```
Read portfolio/clarity-budget-web/CLAUDE.md and portfolio/clarity-budget-web/HANDOFF.md first.
Run checkpoint before touching anything.

Continuing: clarity-budget-web, branch main
Last commit: 7a461b6 — fix(clarity-budget-web): break /settings token migration loop + add server budget proxy

## State coming in (2026-04-28)

Everything is committed and on main. Production may not be up-to-date (preview deployment
clarity-budget-nb9nu9ctb-iamchasewhittakers-projects.vercel.app is at 7a461b6; production
domain clarity-budget-web.vercel.app may still be on the prior deployment).

## Step 0 — promote or re-deploy (you do this)
Option A: `vercel promote clarity-budget-nb9nu9ctb-iamchasewhittakers-projects.vercel.app`
Option B: Push any trivial commit to main to trigger the GitHub auto-deploy webhook.
After this, verify: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://clarity-budget-web.vercel.app/api/ynab/budgets`
→ expect 401 (not 404).

## Step 1 — signed-in smoke test (you do this in browser)
Sign in at clarity-budget-web.vercel.app

1. `/settings`
   - Yellow "Move your YNAB token" banner should NOT appear.
   - YNAB card should show "Token stored in Supabase ✓ [Replace]".
   - Budget dropdown should populate with your YNAB budgets.
2. `/categorize` → click "Run categorization"
   - Should return a summary (auto-applied + queued counts), NOT a schema cache error.
   - Re-run should show cached > 0 (idempotency).
3. Dashboard `/`
   - STS metrics should still load.
   - No token input visible.

## Step 2 — optional fix-up
If the production preview env is missing AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY:
- `vercel env add AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY preview` — or set via Vercel dashboard.

## Step 3 — Step 6 of the redesign: `/review` UI
Once smoke passes, build the proposals review queue:
- `app/(app-shell)/review/page.tsx` — server component; queries `clarity_budget_proposals` via `createRouteClient()`; passes list to `ProposalList`.
- `components/review/ProposalList.tsx` — renders a list of `ProposalRow`.
- `components/review/ProposalRow.tsx` — shows payee rename suggestion (current name → proposed name), Accept / Reject buttons → POST to a new `/api/proposals/[id]/route.ts`.
- `app/api/proposals/[id]/route.ts` — PATCH: accept → set `status='accepted'`, write `clarity_budget_privacy_cards.linked_payee_id`; reject → set `status='rejected'`.
- `components/shell/NavBar.tsx` — add "Review" link between Categorize and Settings.

Plan: plans/clarity-budget-web-redesign.md (Step 6).
```

---

## Redesign context

Full plan: `plans/clarity-budget-web-redesign.md` (10-step implementation order).
Handoff doc that started this: `plans/clarity-budget-web-redesign-HANDOFF.md`.

**What the redesign adds:**
- Privacy.com payee-rename review queue (`/review`)
- Weirdness flags inbox (`/flags`)
- 15-min Vercel cron (server-side, no browser tab needed)
- Encrypted Supabase token storage (YNAB + Privacy.com keys)
- Supabase auth becomes required (magic link)
- Frontend IA restructure (no visual refresh)

**Money Companion (Phase 2):** deferred until v1 redesign ships.

---

## What was built — Session 3: Redesign step 1 (2026-04-23)

### New packages
- `@supabase/ssr ^0.10.2` — server client factory with cookie support
- `server-only 0.0.1` — prevents accidental client bundle inclusion

### New files
- `lib/crypto.ts` — AES-256-GCM `encrypt` / `decrypt` / `maskToken`. Reads `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (32-byte base64). `KEY_VERSION = 1` for future rotation tracking. `server-only` guarded.
- `lib/supabase-server.ts` — two factories: `createRouteClient()` (cookie-bound via `@supabase/ssr` for route handlers) and `createServiceClient()` (service-role, no session, for cron). `server-only` guarded.
- `supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql` — 7 tables: `clarity_budget_credentials`, `clarity_budget_privacy_cards`, `clarity_budget_privacy_transactions`, `clarity_budget_proposals`, `clarity_budget_flags`, `clarity_budget_audit_log`, `clarity_budget_sync_state`. Distinct trigger function name `clarity_budget_update_updated_at()` avoids collision with Shipyard's trigger in the shared Supabase project.
- `supabase/migrations/0002_rls.sql` — RLS on all 7 tables; `owner_all` policies scoped to `auth.uid() = user_id`.
- `app/api/credentials/route.ts` — `POST` (encrypt-and-upsert only provided fields, write audit log) + `DELETE` (remove row, audit log). Returns 401 before body parse if no session.
- `.env.local.example` updated — `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `CRON_SECRET`, `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` added.
- `.env.local` created (gitignored) — freshly generated `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` + `CRON_SECRET`. **`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is blank** — paste from Supabase dashboard → project settings → API before step 5 (cron).

### Verification results
| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` | ✅ clean |
| `pnpm lint` | ✅ clean |
| `pnpm build` | ✅ `/api/credentials` shows as `ƒ` dynamic |
| Crypto round-trip (encrypt → decrypt) | ✅ matches; tamper correctly rejected |
| `curl POST /api/credentials` (unauthenticated) | ✅ 401 |
| `curl DELETE /api/credentials` (unauthenticated) | ✅ 401 |

### Migrations applied 2026-04-24
Both migrations now live on remote project `unqtnnxlltiadzbqpyhh` via `supabase db push`. All 7 `clarity_budget_*` tables confirmed present (HTTP 200 on `/rest/v1/<table>?select=*&limit=0`).

> Note: `supabase migration repair --status reverted 0001 0002` was required first — the tracker thought both were applied even though the DDL had never run. Re-push then succeeded.

---

## What was built — Session 3 / Redesign step 2 (2026-04-24)

### New packages
None — reused `@supabase/ssr` added in step 1.

### New files
- `lib/supabase-browser.ts` — singleton `getSupabaseBrowserClient()` via `@supabase/ssr`'s `createBrowserClient`. Cached in module scope so every `'use client'` call reuses the same client.
- `middleware.ts` (repo root) — Supabase SSR cookie refresher. Runs on every non-asset route and calls `supabase.auth.getUser()` so the auth cookie stays fresh across server renders.
- `app/login/page.tsx` — client component; email input → `signInWithOtp` with `emailRedirectTo: <origin>/auth/callback`. Swaps to "Check your email" confirmation after POST. "Use a different email" button resets to idle.
- `app/auth/callback/route.ts` — reads `?code=`, calls `exchangeCodeForSession`, redirects to `/` on success or `/login?error=callback` on failure.
- `app/(app-shell)/layout.tsx` — Server Component. `createRouteClient()` → `getUser()` → `redirect('/login')` if no user; otherwise renders `<NavBar email={user.email}/>` wrapping `{children}`.
- `components/shell/NavBar.tsx` — client; Dashboard / Settings links with active state via `usePathname()`.
- `components/shell/UserMenu.tsx` — client; email + Sign out button (signs out, routes to `/login`, calls `router.refresh()` so the server layout re-runs its auth check).
- `app/(app-shell)/settings/page.tsx` — server page; renders `<MigrationBanner />` + Step-8 placeholder.
- `components/settings/MigrationBanner.tsx` — client; reads `localStorage[YNAB_TOKEN_KEY]` in a `useEffect`, shows yellow banner if present, `fetch('/api/credentials', POST)`, clears localStorage **only** on 2xx. Inline error on failure (localStorage untouched).

### Moves
- `app/page.tsx` → `app/(app-shell)/page.tsx` (unchanged contents).

### Verification results
| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `supabase db push` (after repair) | ✅ both migrations applied |
| All 7 `clarity_budget_*` tables exist (REST probe) | ✅ HTTP 200 each |
| `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` | ✅ clean |
| `pnpm lint` | ✅ clean |
| `pnpm build` | ✅ `/` `ƒ`, `/login` `○`, `/settings` `ƒ`, middleware compiled (89.7 kB) |
| `GET /` unauthed | ✅ 307 → `/login` |
| `GET /settings` unauthed | ✅ 307 → `/login` |
| `GET /login` | ✅ 200 |
| `POST /api/credentials` unauthed | ✅ 401 |
| `GET /auth/callback` no code | ✅ 307 → `/login?error=callback` |
| Login form submit (real Supabase) | ✅ POST to `/auth/v1/otp` → 200; UI switched to "Check your email" |

### Superseded 2026-04-25 — login switched to password

The OTP/magic-link flow was replaced with `signInWithPassword` (commit `72799f9`). Reason: magic-link emails were redirecting to the dead `apps.chasewhittaker.com` domain (deferred shared-login canonical host) — see `LEARNINGS.md` 2026-04-25 for the full postmortem. `app/auth/callback/route.ts` is left in place as harmless dead code; it'll only fire if OTP is reintroduced.

### Still needs manual verification
- With a pre-seeded YNAB token in localStorage, visit `/settings` → banner appears → Migrate → localStorage key gone, row in `clarity_budget_credentials`, audit log row with `action = 'credentials_upsert'`

---

## What was built — Session 3 / Redesign step 3 (2026-04-25)

### New files
- `lib/privacy/types.ts` — Privacy.com REST response shapes: `PrivacyCard`, `PrivacyTransaction` (with nested `card: PrivacyCardRef` + `merchant: PrivacyMerchant`), `PrivacyPage<T>`, plus `PrivacyCardState` / `PrivacyCardType` / `PrivacyTxStatus` string unions.
- `lib/privacy/client.ts` — `createPrivacyClient(token)` factory. Internal `paginate<T>` walks `page` 1..N (50/page) until `data.length === 0` or `page >= total_pages`. Auth header is `Authorization: api-key <token>` (Privacy's scheme — not Bearer like YNAB). 401 → `"Privacy token invalid or expired."`; other non-2xx → `"Privacy API error: ${status}"`. `server-only` guarded. Endpoints currently `/card` + `/transaction` (singular) — verify against live API during smoke test.
- `lib/privacy/sync.ts` — `pullCards(userId)` + `pullTransactions(userId, since?)`. Both use `createServiceClient()` (no user session) and decrypt the user's `privacy_token_*` from `clarity_budget_credentials` via `lib/crypto.ts`. Each function:
  - Pre-fetches existing rows so user-owned columns survive re-syncs (`linked_payee_id` on cards, `matched_ynab_txn_id` on transactions — never written from sync)
  - Upserts in chunks of 500 with `onConflict: "token"`
  - Stamps `clarity_budget_sync_state` (`source='privacy'`) with `last_run_at` + `last_success_at` on success, `last_error` on failure (truncated to 500 chars)
  - Inserts a `clarity_budget_audit_log` row (`actor='system'`, `entity_type='privacy_sync'`, action `privacy_sync_cards` / `privacy_sync_transactions` on success or `*_failed` on error)
  - Returns `{ fetched, upserted }`; rethrows after recording failure
  - Note: schema CHECK constraint forces `source` ∈ {`ynab`, `privacy`}. Decision: both card + transaction syncs share `source='privacy'`; the cron caller (Step 5) will orchestrate cards-then-transactions atomically. Cursor stays null in v1.

### Verification results
| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` | ✅ clean |
| `pnpm lint` | ✅ clean |
| `pnpm build` | ✅ clean — route table unchanged from Step 2 (no new routes; pure lib code) |

### Still needs manual verification
- With `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` set + a real Privacy.com token upserted via `/api/credentials`: write a one-off `scripts/test-privacy-sync.ts` that calls `pullCards(userId)` then `pullTransactions(userId)`. Probe `clarity_budget_privacy_cards` + `clarity_budget_privacy_transactions` for rows, `clarity_budget_sync_state` for a `source='privacy'` row with `last_success_at`, `clarity_budget_audit_log` for the two `privacy_sync_*` entries. Rerun to confirm idempotency (only `updated_at` advances).
- During that smoke, confirm whether Privacy's current API uses `/card` + `/transaction` (singular — what we wrote) or `/cards` + `/transactions` (plural). Both are in the wild; swap the two strings in `client.ts` if 404s appear.

## Fresh session prompt — unblock smoke + commit + Step 5

```
Read portfolio/clarity-budget-web/CLAUDE.md and portfolio/clarity-budget-web/HANDOFF.md first.
Run checkpoint before touching anything.

Continuing: clarity-budget-web, branch main

## State coming in (2026-04-27)

7 files are uncommitted — credentials fix + YNAB connector moved to Settings.
`/categorize` smoke is blocked by a Supabase data gap. Fix it manually first, then commit.

### Step 0 — manual Supabase fix (you do this, not Claude)
1. Open http://localhost:3000 (or run `cd portfolio/clarity-budget-web && pnpm dev`)
2. Sign in → go to /settings
3. In the YNAB card: re-enter your personal access token (token was cleared from localStorage by
   MigrationBanner even though it's in Supabase — the card reads localStorage, not Supabase).
4. Pick your budget from the dropdown.
5. Confirm in Supabase Studio: clarity_budget_credentials.default_budget_id is now populated.
6. Then try /categorize → Run categorization — expect success.

If you need Claude's help debugging this step, describe what you see in /settings.

### Uncommitted files to commit after smoke passes
New:
- portfolio/clarity-budget-web/lib/categorize/credentials.ts
- portfolio/clarity-budget-web/components/settings/YnabConnectorCard.tsx

Modified:
- portfolio/clarity-budget-web/lib/categorize/run.ts
- portfolio/clarity-budget-web/app/api/categorize/apply/route.ts
- portfolio/clarity-budget-web/lib/blob.ts
- portfolio/clarity-budget-web/components/HomeDashboard.tsx
- portfolio/clarity-budget-web/app/(app-shell)/settings/page.tsx

### After committing, the next task is Step 5 — cron + vercel.json
Files to create:
- app/api/cron/sync/route.ts — POST, validates Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET,
  calls pullCards + pullTransactions (Privacy sync) then runs reconcile (match + propose + detect).
  Returns { ok, cards, transactions, proposals, flags }.
- app/api/cron/backfill/route.ts — one-shot POST to seed historical data (same logic, no schedule).
- vercel.json — crons: [{ path: "/api/cron/sync", schedule: "*/15 * * * *" }]

Prerequisites before Step 5 runs on the server:
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY in .env.local (paste from Supabase dashboard → project settings → API)
- CRON_SECRET in .env.local (already there from Step 1; copy to Vercel env too)
- Privacy.com token upserted via POST /api/credentials { privacy_token: "..." }

Stop after Step 5 and show the diff before moving on.
```
