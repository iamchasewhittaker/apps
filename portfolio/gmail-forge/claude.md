# Gmail Forge — Claude Instructions

## Project
Chase Whittaker's Gmail Forge system. Three-layer architecture: XML filters (instant) → Apps Script auto-sorter (5-min sweep + AI) → Chrome extension (manual UI). No paid tools.

**Owner:** chase.t.whittaker@gmail.com  
**Asana GID:** 1213891408033292  
**Filter file:** `gmail-filters.xml` (import into Gmail when updated)  
**Apps Script:** `apps-script/auto-sort.gs` + `rules.gs` (deploy via [apps-script/DEPLOY-CLASP.md](apps-script/DEPLOY-CLASP.md) or paste in script.google.com)  
**Extension:** `extension/` (load unpacked in Chrome)

## What This App Is

A three-layer Gmail organization system: XML filters for instant sorting, an Apps Script auto-sorter that sweeps every 5 minutes with optional AI classification, and a Chrome extension for manual UI control — all without paid tools. Keeps job search emails untouched in the inbox while routing everything else to appropriate labels automatically.

## Critical Rules

- **Job search emails NEVER get archived** — Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, ZipRecruiter, LinkedIn job alerts/InMail always stay in inbox
- **Kassie's Gmail setup is paused** — Chase's inbox only
- **Re-import XML only when filters change** — not daily
- **Newsletters are labeled but NOT archived** — they stay in inbox (changed 2026-04-27)
- Always check **"Also apply filter to matching conversations"** on import

---

## Daily Report

When Chase says **”report”**, **”email report”**, or **”what's in my inbox”**, run this:

1. Search Gmail for today's **inbox** emails (`after:YYYY/MM/DD in:inbox`) — include read and unread
2. Search Gmail for today's **archived** emails (`after:YYYY/MM/DD -in:inbox -in:sent -in:drafts -in:trash -in:spam`)
3. Read each message (subject + sender + snippet is enough)
4. Output the report in the format below

```
📧 Email Report — [Date]

--- INBOX ---

🚨 Needs Attention
- [sender] — [subject]

💼 Job Search
- [sender] — [subject]

🧾 Receipt/Finance
- [sender] — [subject]

📦 Notification
- [sender] — [subject]

📅 Calendar/Appointments
- [sender] — [subject]

📰 Newsletter
- [sender] — [subject]

📣 Marketing
- [sender] — [subject]

❄️ Cold Email
- [sender] — [subject]

👤 Personal
- [sender] — [subject]

🔐 Security
- [sender] — [subject]

--- AUTO-ARCHIVED ---

🗄️ Auto-archived today ([count] emails)
- [sender] — [subject] — [label applied]
```

Omit any category with zero emails. Omit the AUTO-ARCHIVED section if zero.

**Totals line** at the bottom:

```
📊 Total: [X] inbox / [Y] archived / [X+Y] received today
```

### Inbox leakers (Phase 2)

After the categorized sections, if any **inbox** mail is not explained by job-search whitelist or intentional “keep in inbox” labels, add:

```
📬 Inbox leakers (unlabeled / wrong bucket)
- [sender or domain] — [subject] — why it matters (optional)
```

Log confirmed patterns in [roadmap/inbox-leakers.md](roadmap/inbox-leakers.md) and mislabels in [roadmap/mislabel-audit.md](roadmap/mislabel-audit.md) before editing `gmail-filters.xml`.

## Label Taxonomy

| Label | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Newsletter | Substack, blogs, digests |
| Notification | Apps, services, automated alerts |
| Receipt | Financial transactions, order confirmations |
| Calendar | Appointment reminders |
| Cold Email | Unsolicited outreach |
| FYI | Info-only, no action needed |
| Marketing | Promotional emails from brands |
| Follow-up | Chase needs to follow up |
| To Reply | Requires a response |
| Actioned | Completed |
| Personal | Personal contacts |
| Security | Google account alerts, magic links, account activations |

---

## Adding New Filters

When Chase identifies a new sender to filter:
1. Prefer domain-level matching (`from: domain.com`) over individual addresses
2. Add the entry to `gmail-filters.xml` in the correct section
3. Add the matching domain/address to `apps-script/rules.gs` in the correct label
4. Update the filter count in `claude.md` and `roadmap/roadmap.md`
5. Output the updated `gmail-filters.xml` for download/import

**Note:** With the Apps Script running, new senders are auto-classified by AI. You only need to manually add filters for senders you want to lock in permanently (skip AI cost + guarantee correct label).

### Subject-keyword matching (JobSearch only)

`apps-script/rules.gs` `JobSearch.subjectPatterns` catches recruiter outreach from senders that don't match an ATS domain (e.g., personal Gmail). Matched phrases (case-insensitive): `interview`, `availability`, `phone screen`, `time to chat`, `schedule a/an call|chat|interview|time`. Implemented in `auto-sort.gs` `matchRules_()` after the domain/address/toAlias checks.

### Job Search HQ integration

The `JobSearch` Gmail label is what powers the InboxPanel in [job-search-hq](../job-search-hq/) — JSHQ queries the Gmail API with `labelIds=` (not `from:`), so the label must be applied for emails to appear. Run `healthCheck_jobSearch_()` in the Apps Script editor to verify trigger + label + thread count.

## Import Instructions

1. Gmail → Settings (⚙️) → See all settings → Filters and Blocked Addresses
2. Click **Import filters**
3. Upload `gmail-filters.xml`
4. ✅ Check **"Also apply filter to matching conversations"**
5. Click **Create filters**

---

## Key Rules & Learnings

- Domain-level matching preferred over sender-specific (e.g., `substack.com` not individual addresses)
- **Natia Kurdadze** (natia@space-leads.com) → Newsletter (not Cold Email)
- **Daily Crossword Links** → Newsletter (matched via iCloud Hide My Email alias — see local copy of gmail-filters.xml for actual value)
- Job search senders are whitelisted only — no label, no archive — they stay in inbox naturally
- **ZipRecruiter** is whitelisted at domain level (`ziprecruiter.com`) — catches Phil, alerts, and all ZipRecruiter addresses
- **LinkedIn Messages** (`messages-noreply@linkedin.com`) are labeled Notification but NOT archived — stay in inbox during job search
- The XML file is not in Google Drive — find it in this folder or rebuild from conversation history
- When adding new filters, output a fresh `gmail-filters.xml` for reimport

---

## Automation (Phase 3)

### Apps Script Auto-Sorter
- **Files:** `apps-script/auto-sort.gs` (engine) + `apps-script/rules.gs` (sender rules)
- **Trigger:** 5-minute timer via `setupTrigger()`
- **Flow:** Find unlabeled inbox emails → match against rules.gs → if no match, classify via Gemini (or skip in Rules-only mode) → apply label + archive → log new senders to Google Sheet
- **Config:** Script Properties: `CLASSIFIER_MODE` (`GEMINI`/`RULES_ONLY`), `GEMINI_API_KEY` (for Gemini mode), `SHEET_ID` (optional), `NEWSLETTER_TO_ALIASES` (optional comma-separated **To:** addresses for iCloud newsletter aliases)
- **Job search protection:** Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, ZipRecruiter, LinkedIn job addresses are whitelisted — never touched

### Chrome Extension
- **Files:** `extension/` directory (MV3)
- **Features:**
  - Label tab bar (10 label tabs, active state, URL sync)
  - Unsorted badge (inbox emails with no label, 60s refresh)
  - **Sort button** — select emails → classify (rules / Gemini) → POST to Apps Script `doPost` → apply labels; requires Web App URL + Trigger Token in popup
  - **Guide button (`?`)** — overlay inside Gmail with full feature reference; toggle on click or click outside
  - Toast notifications with graceful teardown on extension context invalidation
- **Settings popup:** Classifier Mode, Gemini API Key, Web App URL, Trigger Token, Visible Tabs
- **Guide minisite:** `guide.html` — standalone dark-mode reference; open directly in browser
- **Install:** `chrome://extensions` → Developer mode → Load unpacked → select `extension/`
- **Sanity check:** `cd extension && npm install && npm run validate` (manifest + required files)
- **After reloading extension:** refresh any open Gmail tabs to reconnect (content script shows a toast if context is invalidated)

### Spend Clarity (Receipt pipeline)

- **Doc:** [integrations/receipt-to-spend-clarity.md](integrations/receipt-to-spend-clarity.md) — Spend Clarity reads `label:Receipt`; keep merchant senders in sync with this repo’s Receipt filters.
