# Roadmap — Spend Clarity

> Python CLI: enriches YNAB transactions from Gmail receipts + auto-categorizes by payee.
> Run: `python3 src/main.py` from `portfolio/spend-clarity/`

## Current state — v0.2.0

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| YNAB API read (transactions, categories) | ✅ Done |
| Gmail OAuth + receipt parsing (Amazon, Apple, DoorDash) | ✅ Done |
| Privacy.com API client | ✅ Done |
| Receipt → YNAB transaction matching (amount ± $0.50, date ± 6 days) | ✅ Done |
| Memo formatting + YNAB PATCH write (dry-run default) | ✅ Done |
| `payee_formatter.py` — bank noise strip + 50+ merchant map | ✅ Done |
| `category_rules.yaml` — keyword rules + payee_rules (12 groups, correct budget IDs) | ✅ Done |
| `category_overrides.yaml` — user-editable corrections, checked first | ✅ Done |
| Three-tier `Categorizer` (overrides → payee rules → keywords) | ✅ Done |
| Step 4.5: categorize ALL blank-memo transactions by payee | ✅ Done |
| `setup_categories.py` — emoji stripping + duplicate name handling | ✅ Done |
| 57 tests passing (`test_payee_formatter.py`, `test_categorizer.py`) | ✅ Done |

## V1 Backlog (next up)

| # | Priority | Task | Why |
|---|----------|------|-----|
| 1 | ✅ Done | Startup validation — check that at least one category ID resolves against live budget | Shipped: startup now logs valid/invalid IDs and fails fast when none resolve |
| 2 | 🔴 High | `venv` + `requirements.txt` install instructions in README | `bs4`, `pyyaml`, `google-auth-oauthlib` need to be installed before first run |
| 3 | ✅ Done | Scheduled run via `launchd` — auto-enrich on a cron (e.g. nightly) | Shipped: `scripts/install_launchd_job.sh` + plist template + README ops commands |
| 4 | ✅ Done | Unmatched report improvement — show which payee rule (if any) was tried and why it failed | Shipped: merchant candidates + closest date/amount mismatch diagnostics in report |
| 5 | 🟡 Medium | `category_overrides.yaml` auto-suggest — print "add this override?" prompt when a pattern fails | Reduces friction for adding corrections |
| 6 | 🟢 Low | Amazon payee sub-categorization — detect "Amazon Fresh" → Groceries vs default Miscellaneous | Amazon is intentionally excluded from payee rules; item-keyword rules handle it, but Amazon Fresh is grocery-only |
| 7 | 🟢 Low | Summary stats at end of run — X categorized, Y memos enriched, Z skipped | Better run feedback beyond the current log |

## V2 Ideas (parked)

| # | Idea | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| V2-1 | Interactive override editor — `python src/main.py --edit-overrides` | Opens YAML in `$EDITOR` after showing unmatched transactions |
| V2-2 | Monthly spending summary — export CSV of categorized transactions | Useful for partner review / budget retro |
| V2-3 | Multiple budget support | Currently hard-coded to one `YNAB_BUDGET_ID` |
| V2-4 | Web UI digest — weekly HTML report emailed to self | Phase 3 of original design |
