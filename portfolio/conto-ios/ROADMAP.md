# Roadmap — YNAB Clarity iOS

> Local iOS app. Reads YNAB via API; can PATCH assigned amounts with confirmation.
> Run in Xcode: ⌘B to build, ⌘R to run, ⌘U for tests.

## V1 — Backlog (next up)

| # | Priority | Task | Why |
|---|----------|------|-----|
| 1 | 🔴 High | Category Setup: persist group name alongside category ID on save | `suggestRole()` uses group name at classify time but if the user re-enters setup, old mappings lose group context |
| 2 | 🔴 High | Fund from Underfunded Goals card on Overview (same PATCH flow as Bills) | Parity with Bills tab; plan called for both surfaces |
| 3 | 🟡 Medium | Refresh indicator — show spinner overlay on cards while `isLoading` is true (not just on first load) | Pull-to-refresh currently shows no loading state on subsequent refreshes |
| 4 | 🟡 Medium | Edit income sources from the Income tab (not just setup) | Currently only editable during onboarding |
| 5 | 🟡 Medium | "Next paycheck" date display on Cash Flow — show days until next income event | Makes the timeline more actionable at a glance |
| 6 | 🟡 Medium | Empty state on Dashboard when no categories mapped | Currently shows zero-value cards with no guidance |
| 7 | 🟡 Medium | Surface PATCH errors to user (toast / banner) if `fundCategory` fails | Today failures are silent (`try?`) |
| 8 | 🟢 Low | Haptic feedback on pull-to-refresh complete | Small polish |
| 9 | 🟢 Low | App icon — custom icon for homescreen | Currently default |
| 10 | 🟢 Low | Category setup: allow reordering role suggestions by priority | Cosmetic |

## V2 — Ideas (parked)

| # | Idea | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| V2-1 | Biweekly paycheck funding tracker — show "you'll have enough after paycheck N" | Extends CashFlowEngine mortgage-marker concept to all required bills |
| V2-2 | Monthly savings rate display — (income - required - flexible spent) / income | Gives a true savings % not visible in YNAB |
| V2-3 | Historical trend — how has safe-to-spend changed month over month | Needs multi-month YNAB API calls |
| V2-4 | Notification on the 1st — "your mortgage needs $X, you have $Y" | Local notification, no server needed |
| V2-5 | TestFlight distribution | Needs Apple Developer account + provisioning |
| V2-6 | Widgets — safe-to-spend today on homescreen | WidgetKit extension |
| V2-7 | Multiple budgets — switch between YNAB budgets | Currently locked to one budget ID |

## Known limitations

- Semi-monthly income sources don't support editing after setup without re-running flow (same gap as other sources → V1 backlog item #4)
- Income sources are set manually — YNAB hint is monthly total only, not per-source
- Fund action assigns to full **goal target** in milliunits (not incremental shortfall only) — confirm UX matches user expectations
